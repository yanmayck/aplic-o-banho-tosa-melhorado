# CI/CD Plan for Furry Friends Agenda

This document outlines a plan for setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Furry Friends Agenda application, likely using GitHub Actions.

## Pipeline Goals

*   Automate linting, testing, and building of both frontend and backend applications.
*   Automate Docker image creation and pushing to a container registry.
*   Define a strategy for deploying updates to a target environment.

## Key Pipeline Stages

### 1. On Every Push/Pull Request to `main` or `develop` branches:

*   **Checkout Code:** Get the latest version of the codebase.
*   **Setup Environment:** Install Node.js, pnpm/npm/yarn as needed.
*   **Linting (Frontend & Backend):**
    *   Run ESLint or other configured linters to check code style and quality.
    *   `cd furry-friends-agenda-app && npm run lint`
    *   `cd furry-friends-agenda-backend && npm run lint`
*   **Unit & Integration Tests (Frontend & Backend):**
    *   Run Jest/Vitest tests for both applications.
    *   `cd furry-friends-agenda-app && npm test` (assuming a test script is added)
    *   `cd furry-friends-agenda-backend && npm test`
*   **Build Applications (Frontend & Backend - for verification):**
    *   `cd furry-friends-agenda-app && npm run build`
    *   `cd furry-friends-agenda-backend && npm run build`

### 2. On Merge to `main` branch (or on tag/release):

*   **All stages from step 1.**
*   **Build Docker Images:**
    *   Build the backend Docker image: `docker build -t YOUR_REGISTRY/furry-friends-backend:LATEST_TAG -f furry-friends-agenda-backend/Dockerfile .`
    *   Build the frontend Docker image: `docker build -t YOUR_REGISTRY/furry-friends-frontend:LATEST_TAG -f furry-friends-agenda-app/Dockerfile .`
        *   Ensure build arguments like `VITE_API_BASE_URL` are appropriately passed, possibly from GitHub secrets or environment variables for the specific deployment target.
*   **Push Docker Images to Container Registry:**
    *   Log in to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, AWS ECR, Google Artifact Registry).
    *   Push the tagged images: `docker push YOUR_REGISTRY/furry-friends-backend:LATEST_TAG` and `docker push YOUR_REGISTRY/furry-friends-frontend:LATEST_TAG`.
*   **Deployment (Strategy examples - choose/adapt one):
    *   **Option A: Manual Trigger or GitOps:** The pipeline stops after pushing images. Deployment is handled by a separate process (e.g., ArgoCD watching the registry/Git repo, or a manually triggered deployment script).
    *   **Option B: Scripted Deployment (e.g., to a Cloud VM/Server):**
        *   SSH into the server.
        *   Pull the new images.
        *   Stop the old containers.
        *   Start the new containers using `docker-compose up -d` (with an updated `docker-compose.yml` or environment variables pointing to the new image tags).
    *   **Option C: Deployment to a Managed Service (e.g., AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Azure App Service):**
        *   Use the cloud provider's CLI or SDK to update the service/task definition with the new image URIs.

## Environment Variables and Secrets

*   **GitHub Secrets:** Store sensitive information like `DATABASE_URL` (for production), `JWT_SECRET`, container registry credentials, and cloud provider API keys.
*   **Environment-specific configurations:** Use different secrets or configuration files for different environments (e.g., staging, production).

## Future Considerations

*   **Semantic Versioning and Tagging:** Automatically tag releases based on commit messages (e.g., using semantic-release).
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage cloud resources (databases, load balancers, etc.) using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Integrate with monitoring tools to track application health and performance post-deployment.
*   **Database Migrations:** Incorporate a robust strategy for running database migrations during deployment (e.g., as a step before the new backend version starts, or as a separate job).
